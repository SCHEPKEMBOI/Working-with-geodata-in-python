## Task
The goal is to calculate and plot seasonal weather anomalies and to see how tempatures have chaed in different seasons over the past 100+ years. 

The task was to create a four-panel plot showing the seasonal temperature anomalies for winter, spring, summer, and autumn for the years 1909-2019 and the template for the fina plot is provided below

## The data

A  [data file](data/NOAA_data.txt)  was provided with daily temperature data from Sodankyl√§ from January 1908 to October 2020. The data was downloaded from the [NOAA Global Historical Climate Network database](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/datasets#GHCND) as a text file. The first five lines of the data file can be found below.

```
STATION           STATION_NAME                                       DATE     TAVG     TMAX     TMIN     
----------------- -------------------------------------------------- -------- -------- -------- -------- 
GHCND:FI000007501                                   SODANKYLA-AWS-FI 19080101 -9999    2        -37      
GHCND:FI000007501                                   SODANKYLA-AWS-FI 19080102 -9999    6        -26      
GHCND:FI000007501                                   SODANKYLA-AWS-FI 19080103 -9999    7        -27  
```

The temperatures here are given in degrees Fahrenheit and the important columns are as follows:

- `DATE`: The date in 'YEARMODA' format, where 'YEAR' is the year using 4 digits, 'MO' is the two-digit month, and 'DA' is the day of the month.
- `TAVG`: The average daily temperature in Fahrenheit
- `TMAX`: The maximum daily temperature in Fahrenheit
- `TMIN`: The minimum daily temperature in Fahrenheit

Missing data are identified with `-9999` and more information about the data can be found on the [NOAA website](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/datasets#GHCND).

### Important note about the data!

There are many missing values in the `TAVG` column. For days where the `TAVG` values are missing, there was an additional task to calculate an estimate of the average daily temperature by averaging the `TMAX` and `TMIN` values (in a new column. **Note** don't replace the existing `TAVG` values with your estimates!)

## Instructions
1. Read in the provided data file using pandas and convert missing data to NA values.
2. Fill in the missing values in the `TAVG` column with your estimates of the average daily temperature as noted above in the data section. You can then drop any average daily temperatures that are still missing.
3. Define and use a function to convert temperatures in Fahrenheit to Celsius.
4. Calculate seasonal average temperatures for each season in every year (e.g., Winter 1909, Spring 1909, Summer 1909, ...)

    - The seasons should include the following months:
    
        - Winter: December, January, February
        - Spring: March, April, May
        - Summer: June, July, August
        - Autumn: September, October, November

5. Calculate seasonal average temperatures for the reference period 1951-1980 (e.g., 4 values in total, one for each season)
6. Calculate seasonal temperature anomalies for each year
7. Plot the data as shown in the example above
